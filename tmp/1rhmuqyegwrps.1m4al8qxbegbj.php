					DeFiChain allows every user to create decentralized shares. To do this, it is necessary to deposit a certain amount as collateral in DFI on the blockchain. Buyers of these decentralized shares own a digital token that can be exchanged for DFI at any time. And this always, at the currently valid price of the corresponding share. Owners of these digital tokens thus have a credit against the blockchain and not against other people or centralized companies. The shares on the defichain are thus not backed by real shares. They are backed only by DFIs that have the same euro value as the stock, so the decentralized shares only reflect the price of the stock and do not participate in dividends. The big advantage, besides the worldwide, unlimited access for everyone, is that you hold the private key, so you are the only one who has access to the shares. It is not possible for any other entity, such as a stock broker or a government, to access the shares.
