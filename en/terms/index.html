								DFX expressly states that no investment advisory services are provided on its part. In no event shall the information provided on the Website be construed as advice or recommendations to buy or sell any particular cryptocurrency or to effect any transaction, nor shall the information provided be construed as advice of any other nature, for example, tax or legal.

These may be economic as well as human and technical in origin. Cryptocurrencies are subject to significant volatility. The price of cryptocurrencies may fall as well as rise. The future performance of cryptocurrencies cannot be guaranteed by past performance. Therefore, it is possible that the invested amount may not be recovered and instead may be lost altogether.

								<h4>Confidentiality and encryption</h4>
              		We would like to point out that the data exchanged between the respective customer and DFX is transmitted via open, public networks (e.g. the Internet), which are not subject to any control or verification on the part of DFX. The transmitted data may go beyond the borders of Switzerland, even if both the customer and DFX are located in Switzerland. Furthermore, even if the transmitted data is encrypted, it is not guaranteed that it will necessarily remain encrypted for the entire duration of the transmission, nor that it will remain encrypted on the Customer's side. It is possible that data may be intercepted. In addition, Customers hereby acknowledge that they understand that applicable laws in your country may prohibit or restrict the import, export, or use of encryption algorithms. DFX shall in no event be responsible for any violation of measures regulating the import, export or use of encryption algorithms. In the event of such a violation, customers are solely responsible.

							</p>

DFX reserves the right, in case of such improper use of the Website or the Payment Page, to deny the relevant customer access to the Website and the Payment Page, even if the customer is a registered customer of DFX.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Handling of customer-related data</h4>
								Customers acknowledge that DFX may record and analyze all of its customers' actions on DFX-owned websites, APIs, applications, and other direct marketing campaigns for purposes of security, system monitoring, administration, marketing, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
								DFX will store this information under appropriate security conditions for a limited period of time. DFX will not disclose personal information to third parties unless DFX is required to do so by law and/or regulation.
								DFX's technical support is provided by a third party contracted by DFX. When support is used, personal data - such as user name, first and last name, e-mail address, telephone number, IP address and payment information of the customer - is stored by this external support service provider.
								In addition, in order to provide straightforward customer support, volunteer support staff have access to a certain part of the database (so-called transaction data). This data relates to the users' transactions and includes transaction ID, user ID, IBAN address, amount of the respective transaction, reference code, blockchain address as well as the corresponding transaction information including the transaction confirmation with the transaction details. The first name, last name and other personal data are not part of this data. Furthermore, no conclusions can be drawn from this data regarding the first and last name as well as other personal data.
								The authentication of the identification documents submitted by customers as part of the registration process is carried out by a specialized external company. Consequently, this company has access to (exclusively) these documents.
								Other necessary external providers may also have access to your data as part of the maintenance and management of the current processes, product and service offering and DFX user base. In such cases where the use of an external provider or service is necessary, DFX will ensure that the external provider exercises the same level of vigilance with respect to privacy and data security as DFX does. Your data and/or contact information will not be sold by DFX in any way.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>User Registration</h4>
									Before DFX's financial services can be used, the customer must register via the DFX app or on the payment page. Registration is free of charge and leads to the creation of a user profile after acceptance of the current terms and conditions. In addition, a non-custody wallet is created. DFX has no access to this, only the customer.
									When a customer registers, the information and documents that the customer must submit to DFX and the maximum amount for which the customer can buy or sell, respectively, stake cryptocurrencies depend on his identification level:
									Registration is basically done via the blockchain address, specifying the customer's email or phone number. This registration is considered standard - light KYC (Know-your-Customer) - and allows the customer to buy/sell cryptocurrencies up to a limit of 1,000 Swiss francs (CHF) / 900 euros (EUR). Transfers of cryptocurrencies to a non-verified public address are not accepted.

									For the purchase/sale of cryptocurrencies above 1,000 Swiss Francs (CHF) / 900 Euros (EUR), more detailed registration is required, which is considered an Extended - full KYC (Know-your-Customer) - process. As part of this process, the following information in particular must be disclosed to DFX:
									Address, with their proof of delivery of a letter to the specified address....
									Copy of identification document (ID card or passport), which must have a signature, a legible MRZ code and a photo.
									Current photo of the customer.
									Duly completed DFX registration form (so-called chatbot form according to the specifications of the Association for Quality Assurance of Financial Services (VQF)).
									Properly completed beneficial owner form.
									First transaction from a bank account in the customer's name to DFX.
									In case of registration of the customer by phone number, the customer has to confirm the code received by SMS (so called TAN code) to DFX.
									Up to which limit the purchases/sales of cryptocurrencies as well as for the Staking will be executed, will be decided user-specific by DFX. Detailed information is available from support. Staking is only possible via full KYC process.
									DFX reserves the right to conduct a video conference to verify the customer's identity, including if: DFX believes that the documentation provided is incomplete; the customer's place of residence or business is in a country of risk; or the first transaction made on the part of the customer was from a country of risk or through a bank account not in the customer's name.
									The complete and correct submission and validation of these documents is required for the initial purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, for staking as well as for the conversion of cryptocurrencies, or at any time DFX may request without giving reasons.
									The data provided must be complete and valid at all times. Changes to personal data as well as all data underlying the light or full KYC must be communicated by the customers to DFX without delay.
									DFX will never ask customers for such customer-related information by e-mail or telephone and will never disclose the password to third parties. Such requests are to be ignored and reported to DFX.
									Customers are not authorized to allow others to access their account. They are responsible for all activities performed with their respective account.

									DFX may reject any registration without giving any reason, bar any registered customer - including in case of fraud, attempted fraud, forged securities or forged certificates - or refuse to execute any transaction.
									Blocked customers may not re-register via the DFX app or payments page. If they do so, these users may be subject to criminal prosecution. Only natural persons or legal entities may register via the DFX app or the payment page. Natural persons must also be capable of acting (capable of judgement and at least 18 years old). Persons under 18 years of age may not register on the website.
									Each customer profile is unique, personal and non-transferable. The creation and use of multiple accounts by the same person is prohibited.

									Customers may delete or deactivate their account at any time by submitting a request to DFX technical support. DFX is obliged to keep records of transactions for ten years. This period starts from the end of the execution of the transactions or, if more than one transaction forms a whole, from the end of the last transaction. Only after the expiration of this ten-year retention period will the account finally be deleted.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>User registration</h4>
								The use of DFX's financial services requires registration on the website. Registration is free of charge and leads to the creation of a user profile after acceptance of the current General Terms and Conditions. The submission and validation by DFX of various documents referred to in these General Terms and Conditions is required for the purchase and sale as well as the staking of cryptocurrencies and for the conversion of cryptocurrencies. There is no pre-existing registration fee. DFX may reject any registration without giving any reason, expel any registered user - including in case of fraud, attempted fraud, fake securities or fake certificates - or refuse to complete a transaction. Blocked users are not allowed to register on the website again. If they do so, such users may be subject to criminal prosecution. To register on the Website, you must be a natural or legal person. You must also be capable of exercising your civil rights (at least 18 years old and capable of judgment). Persons under 18 years of age may not register on the Website. Each user profile is unique, personal and non-transferable. The creation and use of multiple accounts by the same person is prohibited.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Conditions for the purchase of cryptocurrencies</h4>
								The Customer shall execute the purchase following the instructions in the DFX App or on the DFX Payment page, respectively. In order to initiate a purchase, the customer must create a corresponding payment route. In doing so, the customer has:
								Select "Wallet" as the type;
								Specify as "Asset" the cryptocurrency he wants to buy;
								Specify a [blockchain address (for crypto-to-crypto transactions)] respectively an IBAN of a bank account that is valid and freely available to the customer;
								If an invalid address/account or an address/account that does not belong to the customer is provided, the funds may be lost. DFX may make inquiries to attempt to recover lost cryptocurrencies, but is under no obligation to do so. These inquiries are at DFX's sole discretion. Customer shall pay for the cost of any investigation, which shall take into account the technical complexity and time required for the investigation.

								The system will then generate for the customer the so-called route details consisting of the specific details of the type, asset, IBAN, payment purpose [XXXX-XXXX-XXXX, where the "X" represent capital letters or numbers], fee, volume and annual volume.
								Specifying the payment purpose generated in the route details, the customer then transfers from his bank account, whose IBAN he has specified to DFX [respectively from his wallet, whose blockchain address he has specified to DFX], the amount he wishes to convert into (other) cryptocurrencies to DFX. The transfer can be made in currencies such as Euros, US Dollars or Swiss Francs, or any other currency eligible for the transaction, by bank transfer or by any other means of payment available on DFX's website. [In the case of a crypto-to-crypto transaction, the customer triggers a transfer via his wallet instead of his bank account].
								If the above payment purpose does not appear on the payment order, the money will be refunded to the corresponding customer. Bank fees will be charged to the customer, and an additional administrative fee may also be charged.
								Adjustment of the amount specified in the purchase route.
								DFX provides its service to the extent of the amount actually received by it on the DFX Wallet. Bank charges or transaction fees will be borne by the customer and will be deducted directly from the amount originally paid in, if this had not already been done when the transaction was received. If applicable, administrative fees will also be charged to the customer. DFX will then exchange the equivalent of the amount actually received, minus any additional bank or transaction fees and minus DFX's own fees (see below), into the desired cryptocurrency.
								If the customer paid the amount to be exchanged in a FIAT currency other than EUR, DFX will first exchange this currency into EUR, whereby additional exchange fees may be incurred, which will also be deducted directly from the amount paid in.

								Execution of the purchase route
								Upon receipt of the buy route, the amount paid in by the customer in this context and after adjustment for all applicable fees, DFX will buy the cryptocurrencies specified in the buy route for its own holdings in the sense of a principal transaction and subsequently transfer the cryptocurrencies to the wallet specified by the customer.
								The actual cryptocurrency exchange is thereby basically executed at the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) of DeFiChain. The exchange rate for cryptocurrencies is determined at the time the transaction is received on the DFX wallet and can therefore vary greatly. In this regard, the exchange rate corresponds to the rate visible on the website www.defichain.com/dex.
								In case of a desired exchange in dUSDT, dUSDC or dBTC, DFX will pass on to the customer the official rate from the Kraken trading platform (www.kraken.com), thus saving the customer the DEX fee.

								DFX points out that the purchase may take several business days before the desired cryptocurrency arrives in the customer's wallet.

								The transaction costs of the cryptocurrencies sent to the customer are included in the base price. Prices are in euros, US dollars or Swiss francs, or any other currency that is acceptable for payment. [For crypto-to-crypto transactions, prices are in the cryptocurrency to be exchanged]. Likewise, the price includes Swiss value added tax (hereinafter: VAT), if applicable.

								After the transfer of the desired cryptocurrency to the customer's wallet, the purchase is considered completed. The Customer will receive a confirmation of the transaction completion by email, including a transaction summary.

								DFX points out that per day and per customer a maximum purchase volume of 90'000 EUR or 100'000 CHF can be processed. Exceptions may be considered and will be discussed on an individual basis. On the other hand, there is no minimum purchase volume.

								A transaction to the DFX Wallet without a previously created purchase route will not be accepted by DFX and will be immediately refunded to the customer. Any bank charges incurred in this regard will be borne by the customer. The customer may also be charged administrative fees.

								Cancellation of the purchase route
								Purchase routes can be cancelled as long as the amount has not been received by DFX. Bank fees will be charged to the customer, and the customer may also be charged an additional administration fee.

								Network fees
								In connection with the creation of the purchase routes, DFX reserves the right to charge the network fee to the customer at the time the transaction is made.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Conditions for the sale of cryptocurrencies</h4>
								The customer has to execute the sale following the instructions on the payment page/in the app. In order to trigger a sale, the customer must create a corresponding payment route (sales route) for the sale. In doing so, the customer must:
								[specify the desired payment currency;
								[specify a blockchain address of a wallet or] an IBAN of a bank account that is valid and freely available to the customer.
								If an invalid address/account or an address/account that does not belong to the customer is provided, the funds may be lost. DFX may make inquiries to attempt to recover lost cryptocurrencies, but is under no obligation to do so. These inquiries are at DFX's sole discretion. Customer shall pay for the cost of any investigation, which shall take into account the technical complexity and time required for the investigation.

								The system will then generate for the customer the so-called route details consisting of the specific details of currency, IBAN, deposit address, fee, min. deposit and volume.
								After the route details have been created, the customer transfers the cryptocurrency he wants to sell to the corresponding DFX wallet specified by DFX, specifying his IBAN[/his wallet].


								If a transfer is made to the DFX Wallet without first creating a corresponding sell route, or if a transfer is made to an address other than the one specified by DFX, the amount transferred may be lost. DFX may in such cases make inquiries to try to recover lost cryptocurrencies, but is under no obligation to do so. These inquiries are at DFX's sole discretion and may be conducted if large amounts of money are involved. Customer shall be responsible for the cost of any investigation and any administrative fee, which shall take into account the technical complexity and time required for the investigation. All requests for cryptocurrency recovery must be made through DFX technical support.

								Adjustment of the amount specified in the sales route.
								DFX provides its service to the extent of the amount actually received by it on the DFX Wallet. Bank charges or transaction fees will be borne by the customer and will be deducted directly from the amount originally paid in, if this was not already done when the transaction was received. If applicable, administrative fees will also be charged to the customer. DFX will subsequently exchange the equivalent value of the amount actually received minus any additional bank or transaction fees and minus DFX's own fees (see below) into the desired foreign currency [or cryptocurrency].
								If the customer requests a payout currency other than EUR, additional exchange fees may apply, which will also be deducted directly from the deposited amount.


								Execution of the sales route
								After the creation of the sales route, the amount paid in by the customer in this context and after adjustment for all fees incurred, DFX sells the cryptocurrencies specified in the sales route for its own holdings in the sense of a principal transaction and then transfers the foreign currencies [or converted cryptocurrencies] to the [wallet/]account specified by the customer.
								The actual cryptocurrency exchange is generally executed at the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) of DeFiChain. The exchange rate for cryptocurrencies is determined at the time the transaction is received on the DFX wallet and can therefore vary greatly. In this regard, the exchange rate corresponds to the rate visible on the website www.defichain.com/dex.
								In case of a desired exchange in dUSDT, dUSDC or dBTC, DFX will pass on the official rate from the trading platform Kraken (www.kraken.com) to the customer, thus saving the DEX fee.

								DFX points out that the sale can take up to seven business days until the amount is received by the recipient.

								The transaction costs of the [crypto or] foreign currencies transmitted to the customer are included in the base price. The prices are in the cryptocurrency permitted for the transaction and include Swiss value added tax (hereinafter: VAT), if applicable.

								After the transfer [of the desired cryptocurrency respectively] of the desired foreign currency to the customer's account[/wallet] has taken place, the sale is considered completed. The customer will receive a confirmation of the transaction completion by email, including a transaction summary.

								Transaction processing - duration and volume
								Sales routes are processed by DFX within seven business days after the transaction has been made to the DFX Wallet. If the sales route is not processed within the above mentioned period, the customer is obliged to inform DFX immediately. If the customer does not comply with this obligation, he cannot make any claims regarding the change in the exchange rate.

								DFX points out that a maximum sales volume of 90,000 EUR or 100,000 CHF can be processed per day and per customer. Exceptions may be considered and will be discussed on an individual basis.

								Cancellation of the sales route
								Sales routes can be cancelled as long as the cryptocurrency to be converted has not yet been received by DFX.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Conditions for Staking of cryptocurrencies</h4>
								If EUR, CHF or USD are exchanged into cryptocurrency by the customer first for Staking, the terms and conditions for the purchase of cryptocurrencies are applicable.
								Accordingly, a Staking order can be recorded in DFX's system and the corresponding transfer can be made by bank transfer or by any other means of payment available in the DFX app. As soon as the amounts intended for Staking are available in the cryptocurrency required for Staking, they are to be transferred by the Customer, or in case of a previous currency exchange by DFX, to a wallet of DFX intended for Staking.
								For the operation of a node on the DeFiChain, at least CHF 50,000 is required. This is then the minimum amount needed to run the Stake. In order to provide access to the Staking to all customers, the cryptocurrencies intended for Staking are held in the pool by several customers on a wallet of DFX. Once the minimum amount required for Staking is available on DFX's pooled wallet, DFX will execute the Stake on its own behalf but for the account of the customers. Staking may commence within 8 hours after DFX has reached the minimum amount.
								Immediately after completion of the Staking, DFX will transfer the Customer Assets back to the Customers' Wallets, to which DFX has no access. Alternatively, DFX will exchange the cryptocurrencies back into CHF, EUR or USD upon instruction of the customer prior to payout. In the latter case, the terms and conditions for the sale of cryptocurrencies apply. The customer assets are held in the DFX wallet designated for staking for a maximum of 60 days. The settlement period between the termination of the staking and the deblocking of the DFI tokens in the DFX Wallet is 16 hours. Only after the expiration of these 16 hours, DFX can transfer the assets back to the respective customer wallets.
								A customer can terminate the staking of its crypto assets via the DFX system by giving 24 hours' notice at the end of each month. The first possible termination date is March 31, 2022.
								DFX points out that a maximum staking volume of 100,000 EUR or 100,000 CHF can be settled per day and per customer. Exceptions may be considered and will be discussed on an individual basis.
								Staking rewards will be credited by DeFiChain to the pooled DFX wallet respectively. DFX distributes staking rewards to customers on a daily basis. These staking rewards can either be reinvested directly by the customer, paid out to the customer's wallet or transferred directly to the customer's bank account.

									<h4>Fees</h4>
												Our fee structure applies to payments in the SEPA payment system [as well as crypto-to-crypto transactions]. DFX reserves the right to charge additional fees in case of transfers using other payment systems. When using referral links, the fee structure changes (see section below).
												Percentages are calculated on actual transaction volume. The transaction volume figures are in EUR in the tables below. [In case of a crypto-to-crypto transaction, the volume would be converted into EUR accordingly using the daily exchange rate (www.defichain.com/dex or www.kraken.com) in order to be able to determine the amount of the fees].

							<h4>Referral Links</h4>
          			Our referral program pays customers a maximum of 0.5% on the purchase/investment volume purchased by a new customer via the customer's referral link. The referral program has a cap of CHF 100'000 purchase volume per customer or the equivalent in any other offered currency. This means that the referral program is only valid up to a total referral bonus of CHF 500 per customer: CHF 100000 * 0.5% = CHF 500. If the purchase volume of a customer exceeds CHF 100,000, which has been processed through this referral link, no more bonus will be paid. However, the number of customers acquired through referral links is unlimited. DFX reserves the right to change or terminate the referral program at any time without giving reasons. There is no entitlement to continuous referral bonus payments in case of termination of the referral program.

								<h4>Risks</h4>
								DFX points out that the cryptocurrencies offered are on the DeFiChain blockchain. DeFiChain is a project in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) business area. Decentralized Finance is a novel construct where it is not yet fully clear what the legal and regulatory implications will be for users and businesses in this business area.
								DFX always complies with the current Swiss law and is in constant exchange with the authorities to implement this. DFX reserves the right to suspend trading of individual cryptocurrencies at any time or to add additional cryptocurrencies or products to its offering. Customers of the DFX Brokerage Service are not entitled to trade cryptocurrencies if they have previously been suspended from trading. This also applies if these cryptocurrencies have previously been purchased through the DFX Brokerage Service.

								Furthermore, cryptocurrencies that originate from the Decentralized Finance construct, e.g. by trading on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) or by an exchange through an Atomic Swap, may be declared as Coins with increased risk and may be treated differently in the future than Coins that have not been in such DeFi protocols. DFX has no influence on how the DeFi market will be regulated in the future and what consequences the use of DeFi protocols may have for users in the future. DFX cannot guarantee to continue operating the service at all times, nor can DFX guarantee to take back sold coins if the regulatory environment changes. This also applies to cryptocurrencies used for staking. The staked cryptocurrencies basically experience the same fate as the cryptocurrencies used for this purpose per se.
